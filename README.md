# 1. Introduction
Application is deployed & able to be previewed on following link - [TBA]()

MoonüåïÔ∏èDo is XCM Transactor related UI enhancement tool, that also implements Sovereign account generator. It is designed to save users time not requiring as many details as it would be necessary to execute XCM Transactor call. All features are designed to be easily found & used right away. 

# 2. Overview
There are not that many XCM Transactor and Sovereign account generating UI tools focusing on enhancing this technology. MoonüåïÔ∏èDo focuses on ease of use, being fast, secure & user friendly. User no longer needs to go through a lengthy process to generate a sovereign account manually. They can do it with a few specific details & simple click of a button. Moreover, they can execute XCM or many else calls with XCM Transactor from a different chain with a user-friendly UI.

The project allows user to start Application, that can right out of the box generate sovereign account addresses for cross-chain transfers to/from the Relay chain. User can also create XCM Transactor calls from Parachain to do actions on the Relay chain. Currently available call options that can be executed through XCM Transactor from Moonbase Alpha Parachain:

XCM Transfer Call from Relay Chain to any Parachain connected with HRMP channels
Balance transfer between Relay Chain accounts
Instead of filling lengthy calls MoonüåïÔ∏èDo fills them for you. This for example involves constructing API calls you wish to perform on the Relay chain and computing encoded call data from them. This encoded call data is then used in call executed on Parachain.

In the picture below on the left is the amount of data MoonüåïÔ∏èDo requires & on right is the amount of data you would have to fill to create two calls necessary for XCM call execution through XCM Transactor pallet. You can click on the image to see it in full resolution.

# 3. Installation for local use

Make sure to import Alice account which has permission to execute XCM Transactor calls on Moonbase Alpha into your wallet. These permissions can only be received by governance vote.

### Getting back-end to work
First we start by installing necessary libraries
```
sudo apt install git
```
Ensure you have latest node.js installed if not use following command
```
sudo n stable
```
Clone this repository with command
```
git clone https://github.com/dudo50/MoonDo.git
```

### Importing Alice on Moonbase Alpha
Important details about Alice are displayed below. Please note, that account index you will be promted to enter when filling XCM Transactor call is also displayed below.

Head to Moonbase Alpha node into accounts pallet - [Link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fwss.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/accounts). Click on "Add account" and enter private key displayed below.
```
Alice private key: 0x28194e8ddb4a2f2b110ee69eaba1ee1f35e88da2222b5a7d6e3afa14cf7a3347   //Private key you import into Moonbase Alpha
Alice address: 0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55                               //Just to let you know
Alice account index: 42                                                                 //Will be needed in application
```
Once you enter private key and submit, you should receive JSON file. This JSON file can be imported to wallet to import Alice account into it.

#### PLEASE NOTE: Currently TransactorXCM calls can only be executed through Talisman wallet as there is an open PR issue with Polkadot JS wallet & AccountKey20 address types. Talisman however works perfectly!

### After the repository is cloned proceed to install application dependencies with
```
npm install
```

### Launching application after dependencies are installed
```
npm run serve
```
